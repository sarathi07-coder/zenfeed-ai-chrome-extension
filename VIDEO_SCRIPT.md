**Team:** Team 32

## 0:00 - 0:30 | 🛑 The Problem Statement

**(Visual: Fast-paced montage. Someone sitting at a desk, looking tired. Screen shows YouTube Shorts scrolling endlessly. A clock ticking rapidly from 10 PM to 2 AM.)**

**Audio:**
"We've all been there. You sit down to watch one quick tutorial, and suddenly, two hours have vanished into a black hole of Shorts, memes, and reaction videos.

Social media algorithms are engineered to hijack our dopamine pathways, costing us hours of productivity every single day. Traditional blockers are too rigid—they just say 'NO' and break your flow. We realized that to fight AI-driven distraction, we needed an AI-driven solution."

## 0:30 - 1:00 | 🤖 Why Agents?

**(Visual: Split screen. Left side: "Old Way" showing a static "Site Blocked" error page. Right side: "ZenFeed Way" showing a brain icon analyzing content and offering a helpful alternative.)**

**Audio:**
"Why did we choose AI Agents? Because addiction is dynamic. A static rule doesn't understand context. Is this gaming video a distraction, or are you a game developer doing research?

Agents allow us to **understand intent**. Instead of blindly blocking URLs, our agents analyze the *content* of the video in real-time. They reason, they adapt, and they don't just stop you—they guide you. We're moving from restriction to redirection."

## 1:00 - 1:45 | 🏗️ The Architecture

**(Visual: A clean, animated diagram. A central "Orchestrator" node connects to 5 surrounding nodes. Lines pulse with data as they are mentioned.)**

**Audio:**
"We built a sophisticated multi-agent system powered by **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

At the center is the **Orchestrator**, the brain that manages the workflow. It coordinates five specialized agents:
1.  **Feed Ingestion Agent:** Scans your screen to extract video metadata.
2.  **Content Classification Agent:** Uses Gemini to detect addictive patterns like clickbait or rage-bait.
3.  **Addiction Scoring Agent:** Calculates a real-time risk score for every video.
4.  **Recommendation Optimizer Agent:** The magic piece—it finds productive alternatives, swapping that cat video for a Python tutorial.
5.  **Extension Control Agent:** Manages the Chrome interface to apply the intervention seamlessly."

## 1:45 - 2:15 | 🛠️ The Build

**(Visual: Quick shots of the code editor, the Dockerfile, the FastAPI swagger docs, and the Gemini API console.)**

**Audio:**
"We built ZenFeed using a robust tech stack. The backend is **FastAPI**, hosting our agent swarm in a containerized **Docker** environment.

We leveraged **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for its incredible speed and reasoning capabilities—essential for analyzing video titles and generating alternatives in milliseconds without slowing down the browser.

The frontend is a custom **Chrome Extension** that injects our 'Blur & Replace' UI directly into the YouTube DOM, ensuring a native, pixel-perfect experience that feels like part of the platform."

## 2:15 - 2:45 | 🚀 The Demo

**(Visual: Screen recording of the actual extension in action.)**

**(Action: User opens YouTube. A "Learning Mode" banner appears.)**
**Audio:** "Here it is in action. ZenFeed starts by learning your baseline behavior."

**(Action: User clicks on a "Shorts" video or a distracting meme video. The video loads, but instantly gets covered by a dark blur overlay with a 🚫 icon.)**
**Audio:** "When we try to watch a distracting video, the agents intervene instantly. The content is blurred."

**(Action: User moves mouse over the 'Watch Alternative' button. It highlights. User clicks it, and a Python tutorial opens in a new tab.)**
**Audio:** "But look at this—we're offered a choice. With one click on 'Watch Alternative', ZenFeed redirects that dopamine craving into something productive. From doom-scrolling to learning—in seconds."

## 2:45 - 3:00 | 🏁 Conclusion

**(Visual: ZenFeed Logo appears on screen with "Team 32" text below it.)**

**Audio:**
"ZenFeed isn't just a blocker; it's an intelligent accountability partner that helps you reclaim your time.

We are **Team 32**, and this is ZenFeed AI. Thank you."
